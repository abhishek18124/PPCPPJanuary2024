When we calculate the mid point 'm', we ask the question

	can 'k' painters paint 'n' boards of given 'len' in 'm' amt. of time ?

	now, we can rephrase this question in two ways

	1. how many painters are required to paint 'n' boards of given 'len' in 'm' amt. of time ?

	   say, 'x' painters can paint 'n' boards of given 'len' in 'm' amt. of time then

	   case (a)

	   now, if x <= k then that means 'k' painters can also paint 'n' boards of given 'len'
	   in 'm' amt. of time so we get 'true' and move towards the left to minimize time

	   case (b)

	   if x > k then that means 'k' painters cannot paint 'n' boards of given 'len' in 'm'
	   amt. of time i.e we get false and move towards the right.

    2. how many boards of given 'len' can 'k' painters paint in 'm' amt. of time ?
